# Remote delivery 

During the fall 2020 semester, class meetings will be held via [zoom meetings](https://unr.zoom.us/j/92025861279). Maybe this isn't ideal, but if we use interactive features effectively, and take advantage of the fact that there are three of us (myself, Dr. Jahner, and Trevor Faske) to provide one on one feedback, the online format should work quite well for learning Unix and Python. Our strategy will evolve, especially over the first few weeks, with some trial and error, but the below points should provide a starting point for interaction efficiency.

## Lecture and class period format

I will spend no more than 30 minutes of each meeting period going over slides. The information in the slides will be an introduction to programming skills to learn, as well as a review of pitfalls from the previous week. I will likely devote more time typing and running demo code/commands/tricks as the semester goes on during this time.

At least half of each class will be for working through programming tutorials, exercises, or assigned tasks. Roughly one programming task will be assigned as homework most weeks, but there will be weeks where you don't need to turn anything in. 

During this time, myself, Dr. Jahner, and Trevor Faske will be available to answer questions, look over code via screen sharing, and even to type code on your computer with you via remote permissions (if you are ok with this). 

## Please ask questions at ***any time*** during the class period, whether I am talking or not.

Do this by simply clicking the "raise hand" tab in the zoom participants sidebar.

## 6 breakout rooms are setup for people to chat, screenshare, and otherwise work in small groups. 

Note, I encourage students to form small working groups (2-4 individuals) for the semester. Ideally, these groups form naturally through on-on-one communication among peers. Once you have formed such a group, we can assign breakout rooms accordingly.

Josh, Trevor, and I will visit each breakout room regularly, and will respond to questions or calls for help most effectively when they come from specific breakout rooms.

This format will be new to most of us, so we will refine as we go along.

## Screen sharing will help me demo code, and will help us help you. If you are ok with allowing remote control of your keyboard to one of us, we can type while we talk.

I will routinely share my screen to demo Unix and Python code.

Getting comfortable with screen sharing and remote control should also improve the efficacy of working as groups in the breakout rooms.

## Class is scheduled from 6:00-7:10 PM, but I will plan on being present in the zoom meeting for longer (up to 8:00) to make sure everyone gets consulation they may need.
